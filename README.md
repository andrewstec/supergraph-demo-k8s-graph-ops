# Supergraph Demo - GitOps Config Repo

![CI](https://github.com/prasek/supergraph-demo-gitops/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This is the `config repo` for the [apollographq/supergraph-demo](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo) `code repo`.

## Welcome

Apollo Federation and Managed Federation have delivered significant
improvements over schema stitching and alternate approaches. Static
composition introduces another big step forward as we move composition out of
the Gateway and into the CI pipeline where federated graph changes can be
validated sooner and built into static artifacts that define how a Gateway
should route requests across the subgraphs in a federation.

Most contemporary federated GraphQL implementations dynamically compose a
list of implementing services (subgraphs) into a GraphQL Gateway at runtime.
There is no static artifact that can be versioned, validated, or reasoned
about across a fleet of Gateway instances that are common in scale-out
federated graph deployments. Gateways often rely on hard-coded behavior for
directives like `join` or accept additional non-GraphQL configuration.

With static composition, you can compose subgraphs into a supergraph at
build-time resulting in a static artifact (supergraph schema) that describes
the machinery to power a graph router at runtime. The supergraph schema
includes directives like `join` that instruct a graph router how federate
multiple subgraphs into a single graph for consumers to use.

## Overview

This is the `config repo` for the [apollographq/supergraph-demo](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo) `code repo`.

* the [apollographq/supergraph-demo](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo) `code repo` produces the artifacts:
  * subgraph docker images w/ embedded schema
  * supergraph-router docker image that can be fed a composed supergraph schema
    * via the Apollo Uplink - for update in place
    * via a `ConfigMap` for declarative k8s config management

* this config repo has the full k8s configs for dev, stage, and prod environments:
  * cluster - base cluster & GitOps config
  * infra - nginx, etc.
  * router - supergraph router config
  * subgraphs - products, inventory, users

If you're not familiar with `kustomiize` and k8s-native config management, checkout the following:

* [https://kustomize.io/](https://kustomize.io/).
* [kustomize helm example](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-kustomize-helm-example)
* [multi-tenancy example](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-multi-tenancy)

## Deploying a Graph Router to Kubernetes with kustomize

You'll need:

* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
* [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)

then run:

```sh
make demo-k8s
```

which applies the following:

```
kubectl apply -k infra/dev
kubectl apply -k subgraphs/dev
kubectl apply -k router/dev
```

this creates:

* local k8s cluster with the NGINX Ingress Controller
* graph-router `Deployment` configured to use a supergraph `ConfigMap`
* graph-router `Service` and `Ingress`

using [router/base/router.yaml](router/base/router.yaml):

and 3 subgraph services [subgraphs/base/subgraphs.yaml](subgraphs/base/subgraphs.yaml):

`make demo-k8s` then runs the following in a loop until the query succeeds or 2 min timeout:

```sh
kubectl get all
make k8s-query
